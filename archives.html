India Society Ball at the Dorothy Cafe, 5th June 1941.<br><br>Jointly organised by the Cambridge Majlis and the India Society of the London School of Economics, this social provided South Asian students with a space to connect, have a drink and dance. It was typical of the social and cultural events that the Majlis organised — including music, sport and dancing. In addition to political platforms, the Majlis provided sites for socialising that were as central in the making of the South Asian student community, both within and beyond Cambridge. Promoting such elements as “Indian ballet-dance,” these socials also aimed to perform and define the contours of national identities and cultures. Other events, like yearly Majlis dinners, were also organised at Dorothy Café, today known as Waterstones.<br><br>Rare Books Department, Cambridge University Library.">

A few days before, Majlis delegates had gone to the Congress, where it was decided to call “all organisations and individuals standing for peace and progress to associate themselves with the [Congress] and to support its work generally and financially in every possible way.” (Minute book, 262). The Majlis would offer a platform for such congresses, in an effort to “ensure as broad a basis as possible for the Congress itself.” To be sure, the Majlis was active in global student politics, and the 1930s were particularly vital in this respect. On 28th February 1937, the Majlis officially joined the Federation of Indian Students Societies of Great Britain and Ireland (Minute book, 231), which every year from 1937 would organise meetings with student and youth organisations, including the British Youth Peace Assembly, the Young Communist League, and the University Labour Federation. Beyond national politics, the South Asian student community created federations at different levels, such as the global All Indian Student Federation (1936) and the Federation of Indian Student Societies in Europe (1939). The Majlis was an integral part in the making of this student cosmopolitanism.<br><br>The Majlis (an Indian society) Minutes, 262. Wren Library, Trinity College, Cambridge. Code REC. 48.1.">

While women were not allowed to graduate from Cambridge until 1948, they had been at the heart of Cambridge student life since the establishment of two women colleges, Girton and Newnham in 1869 and 1871 respectively. Though the Majlis mainly was a gentlemen’s club throughout the twentieth century, Golbanoo Nanabhai Cowasjee, the only known female President of the Majlis since its revival in 2020, invited feminist speakers over (Minute book, 54) and organised debates on such topics as “the eminent success of women in politics” (Minute book, 49).">

He proposed two “solutions” to “improve the situation that had arisen from the presence of Indian Students at Cambridge.” The first was the creation of a bureau to monitor which Indian students were given permission to attend Cambridge. The second was placing a limitation on the number of Indian students to be admitted by each college to one or two each year. He emphasises the importance of this measure to Marsh, saying that he would not “venture to press the matter upon [Marsh] in this way if the subject were not of real importance from the point of view of the Indian Government”.">

Downing had particularly strong links with the Indian subcontinent. Of the roughly ninety Indian students at the University in the early 1900s, over thirty were at Downing. Most Indian students at Downing came from the commercial elites of western India and Bengal, communities with strong ties to the British since the days of the East India Company. Marsh took a particularly strong stance against the India Office’s Measure. He objected to the limit, saying “if an Indian was expelled without sufficient reason from his College, [Downing] would take him in”. Later, the role of the India Office Bureau was restricted to the monitoring of Indian students in London, with a former member of the Indian Educational Service installed at Magdalene College to monitor and advise Cambridge students.">

Krishna Menon on ‘India and World Struggle’, 28th October 1941.<br><br>This poster compels its audience to “Strengthen the International Front Against Fascism”. Harry Pollit was a British communist who served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) from 1929 to 1939, and again from 1941 until his death in 1960. Throughout his time as leader of CPGB, he was in direct contact with Moscow as CPGB's “Code Holder” and was monitored by the British security services. V.K. Krishna Menon was an Indian academic and politician, and later served as Union Minister for Defence in Nehru’s cabinet. He led the overseas wing of the Indian independence movement, launching the India League in London where he aggressively campaigned to win public support for Indian independence within the UK. This talk was typical of events hosted by the Majlis in the interwar period. Years before, in 1936, Dr. Joseph Neesham, Señora de Hernando, and Reverend Leonard Schiff spoke about the situation in Spain and funds were collected to support Medical Aid in Spain.
